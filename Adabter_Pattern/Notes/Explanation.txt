Adapter Design Pattern:
Adapter Design Pattern is a structural pattern that acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces,
allowing them to work together. It is especially useful for integrating legacy code or third-party libraries
into a new system.

Explain the Diagram:(look at the illustration.png diagarm)
Client wants to use a Target interface (it calls Request()).
Adaptee already has useful functionality, but its method (SpecificRequest()) doesn’t match the Target interface.
Adapter acts as a bridge: it implements the Target interface (Request()), but inside, it calls the Adaptee’s SpecificRequest().
This allows the Client to use the Adaptee without changing its code.

Uses Of Adapter Design Pattern
We can use adapter design pattern when:
Enables communication between incompatible systems.
Reuses existing code or libraries without rewriting.
Simplifies integration of new components, keeping the system flexible.
Centralizes compatibility changes, making maintenance easier and safer.

Below is how adapter design pattern works:
Step 1: The client initiates a request by calling a method on the adapter via the target interface.
Step 2: The adapter maps or transforms the client's request into a format that the adaptee can understand using the adaptee's interface.
Step 3: The adaptee does the actual job based on the translated request from the adapter.
Step 4: The client receives the results of the call, remaining unaware of the adapter's presence or the specific details of the adaptee.
